please read original readme FIRST!!

This is the linux binary release of the Boomerang decompiler version alpha 0.3.

	http://boomerang.sourceforge.net/

You can get source code for this release from the Boomerang CVS, tag alpha-0_3.
The majority of this release is under the terms stated in LICENSE.TERMS.
However, the binary boomerang-gui is linked to the Qt4 library which is under
the terms stated in LICENSE.GPL.  Please ensure that you understand these 
terms before redistributing this archive.

There are a number of dependencies that must be met before these binaries will
run.  You will need:

	libgc
	libexpat

On a debian system you can usually just do:

	apt-get install libgc1c2 libexpat

For the GUI you need:

	the debug libraries for Qt4.

I built Qt4 from source, but you may be able to use a package for your distribution.

Happy decompiling.
